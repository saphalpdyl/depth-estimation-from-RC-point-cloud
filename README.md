# What is this ?
This is a fun little project for calculating depth from a point cloud export from Reality Capture 1.5.

_Note: The depth part is still in the making_

## How to use your own data?
Currently, you can run the program to render the point cloud on `sample` data that I included of my little workspace. However, if you want to experiment with you own data, you require the following files/exports:
- Point cloud in `.ply` format
- Camera parameters in `.csv` format
- Images folder in `.heif` format
- Camera calibration data folder in `.xmp` format
